# Go `Readdir` vs `ReadDir` Micro Benchmark

## Repository Raison d'Être

Go 1.16 [introduced](https://go.dev/doc/go1.16#:~:text=The%20package%20defines,File.ReadDir.)
a new API function in the `os` package called [`ReadDir`](https://pkg.go.dev/os#File.ReadDir).
`ReadDir` has the same functionality as the previously-existing
[`Readdir`](https://pkg.go.dev/os#File.Readdir), (both return a slice of
the contents of a given directory). The intent is that `ReadDir` is _much_
faster than `Readdir`, as `ReadDir` does not stat each file in the directory.

In order to test these claims (and measure the coolness of this new feature),
this repo contains two Go benchmark tests: one for `ReadDir` and one for `Readdir`.

The benchmarked loop for each test consists of:

* Call to `os.Open("/proc")` to get a file handle to read ( + error check)
  * I chose to read `/proc` because it was part of the inspiration for this repo
* Call to the "readdir" function under test ( + error check)

## How to Run the Benchmarks

Install the Go toolchain, navigate into the repo, and run

```go
go test -bench=.
```
